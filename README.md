🔍 Business Insights & Recommendations

🌐 Top Countries

Insight: Most transactions originate from the UK (~90%).

Recommendation: Target marketing campaigns in countries like Germany and the Netherlands to boost international sales.

🌟 Top Products

Insight: A few products account for the majority of revenue.

Recommendation: Optimize inventory and promote best-sellers through bundling or upsell techniques.

🌐 Monthly Trends

Insight: Drop in sales observed post-holiday season (e.g., January).

Recommendation: Launch targeted New Year promotions or discounts to retain momentum.

🌎 Average Basket Value

Insight: Customers spend an average of ~£X per transaction.

Recommendation: Apply cross-sell techniques at checkout to increase average order value.

🔹 RFM Segments (to be completed)

Insight (Expected): High-value customers with declining recency.

Recommendation: Reactivate these segments through personalized email campaigns or loyalty rewards.

🚀 Future Improvements

Add full RFM segmentation and visualize customer clusters

Implement Cohort or Retention Analysis

Create an interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Plotly

Apply clustering (e.g. K-Means) to enhance segmentation
